## Decision System for Credit Underwriting

<b>Credit Karma</b> wants to appraise their potential customer for a loan to scale their lending portfolio. 

Strong underwriting is very critical for <b>reducing the risk</b> and for growing their portfolio and hence, a data driven decision is imperative for the business. 

The current underwriting is <b>manual</b> and standard rules laid by experts, which is <b>time consuming</b>, general and <b>prone to human errors</b> and bias. 


<b>Our aim is to develop a scientifically developed driven system to automate decisions and processing for stronger and quicker underwriting.</b>

### What is Underwriting
